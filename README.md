# Accenture-SocialBuzz
This project is from Accenture Virtual Internship program on theForage.com. 

This is an analysis conducted for an Accenture client called Social Buzz. 

Social Buzz operates in the social media and content creation industry. The business emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. 
There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments to ensures trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds. 

Over past 5years, they’ve reach over 500million users every month. All of the data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. 

The goal for Social Buzz working with Accenture is to: 
1. Complete an IPO by the end of the year
2. Manage their current scale because they are still a small company and do not have resources
3. Learn data best practice from a large corporation.
Also, the client is particularly interested to seeing “an analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.

As the data analyst, my major role was to focus on working on analysing Social Buzz content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity. 
Task include: 
1. Extraction of sample data sets
2. Merging of sample data set tables
3. Analysis of the sample data sets with visualizations

For this task, three relational dataset was provide with a variable description and data model in a star schema format, reaction table, reactiontype table and content table. 
Data model identified the field 'score' as the rational for quantifying the popularity of each reaction type. 

The following was conducted fot this analysis:
1. Requirement gathering:
     Understanding the project brief/data and develop a business question 
3. Data cleaning
4. Data Modelling
5. Analysis
6. Highlighting and visualization of insights
